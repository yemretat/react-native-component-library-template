# React Native Component Library Template


## Introduction

Welcome to the React Native Component Library Template! This template is designed to provide developers with a fast and efficient starting point for building their own React Native component libraries. It includes a set of pre-designed components that are easily customizable to fit your project's unique requirements.

## Features

* Pre-built React Native components ready for customization.
* Integrated with @shopify/restyle for theming and styling.
* Storybook integration for component documentation and testing.
* TypeScript support for type-safe coding.
* Essential development scripts for linting, testing, and building.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-directory]

```
2. Install Dependencies

```
yarn install
```
or 
```
npm install
```
3. Run Storybook (Optional)

To view and test components in Storybook:

```
yarn storybook
```
or
```
npm run storybook
```
## Customizing Components

* All components are located in the src/components directory.
* Use the theme.ts file in the src directory to customize the theme and styles.
* Add or modify components as needed for your specific use case.

## Building Your Library

After making changes, build your component library with:

```
yarn build
```
or
```
npm run build
```

This will compile your TypeScript and JavaScript files to the lib directory.
